The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| TODO     |          |            |                  |

| TODO     |          |            |                  |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the _____ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by _____.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes/No              | 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output](Images/docker_ps_output.png)
 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._



1. Add the sample web log data to Kibana.

2. Answer the following questions:

    - In the last 7 days, how many unique visitors were located in India?

    - In the last 24 hours, of the visitors from China, how many were using Mac OSX?

    - In the last 2 days, what percentage of visitors received 404 errors? How about 503 errors?
    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?
    - Of the traffic that's coming from that country, what time of day had the highest amount of activity?
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?

4. Filter the data by this event.
     - What is the timestamp for this event?
     - What kind of file was downloaded?
     - From what country did this activity originate?
     - What HTTP response codes were encountered by this visitor?

5. Switch to the Kibana Discover page to see more details about this activity.
     - What is the source IP address of this activity?
     - What are the geo coordinates of this activity?
     - What OS was the source machine running?
     - What is the full URL that was accessed?
     - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
